# The beginning of a pretty cool school project!

Lately I've been working on a [Processing](https://processing.org/) project for an Introduction to Programming course. Basically, the idea is to create a simple system for particles to interact with each other, inspired by that game everyone played in high school at one point, the Powder Toy (link). Of course, being an undergraduate software engineering student, I wouldn't be able to simulate fluid dynamics! So instead, I decided to set the bar a bit lower, and just use this project to become more familiar with data structures. 

Now, understandably, having just learned about how data can be stored in these wonderful data structures called arrays, I was completely ready to begin programming particle physics. 

For most in-class assignments, we had been mainly using arrays to store all our information. For example, in one of our exercisees, we were to make many floating bubbles appear on the screen at once, like so:

I stored the position of each bubble in an array, and use a for-loop to increment

I had also dabbled in classes as data structures, so that was also something that I wanted to use. 

The general idea was to create a 'Particle' class which contained information such as it's position, speed, acceleration, colour size and other useful information a particle would want.

The idea was to store information about each particle 



my algorithm for particle movement and collision. 

all that new, fresh knowledge on arrays, functions and other similar beginners' programming concepts, I was ready to
